## Integration with Claude Code
```python
# Called during Step 2
academic_agent_step2 = Task(
    description="Initial academic research",
    prompt=f"Find academic sources on '{topic}' for Step 2",
    subagent_type="academic-research-agent"
)

# Called during Step 6
academic_agent_step6 = Task(
    description="Gap-filling research",
    prompt=f"Find additional academic sources to fill gaps: {identified_gaps}",
    subagent_type="academic-research-agent"
)
```

## Cost Optimization
- Use free Semantic Scholar API first
- Only use Claude API tokens for synthesis/summary
- Cache results in Memory MCP
