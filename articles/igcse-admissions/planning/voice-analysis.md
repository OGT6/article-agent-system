Use questions parents are actually asking: "But what if we're in Singapore?" or "Yes, but how much will this actually cost?"

### Data Integration
Present statistics and requirements within narrative flow, not as isolated facts. E.g., "Those five IGCSEs at grade 4 or above that sixth forms demand might sound reasonable until you realise..."

### Humor Deployment

## Example Transformations

**Generic**: "The IGCSE registration process requires careful planning."
**OxbridgeGCSETutor Voice**: "The IGCSE registration process requires the kind of careful planning usually reserved for military operations or destination weddings, except with more forms and fewer canapés."

**Generic**: "Costs vary by location and exam board."
**OxbridgeGCSETutor Voice**: "Costs vary by location and exam board in ways that would make airline pricing look transparent. In Singapore, you'll pay roughly what UK parents spend, plus 20% for the privilege of air conditioning."

**Generic**: "Missing deadlines can result in late fees."
**OxbridgeGCSETutor Voice**: "Missing deadlines results in late fees that feel specifically designed to punish the sleep-deprived parents who need that money for coffee.""
