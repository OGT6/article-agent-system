# What Are The Key Differences Between IGCSE and GCSE for British Expat Families?

## Quick Answer

IGCSEs and GCSEs are academically equivalent qualifications, but IGCSEs offer an international curriculum while GCSEs focus on UK content. The main practical differences for expat families are availability (IGCSEs are offered in 150+ countries), exam scheduling flexibility, and content relevance to international contexts.

**Key Differences:**
- **Curriculum focus**: IGCSE international vs GCSE UK-centric
- **Availability**: IGCSEs in international schools worldwide, GCSEs mainly UK
- **Grading**: IGCSEs use A*-G, GCSEs use 9-1 system
- **Recognition**: Both accepted equally by UK universities

**For British Expat Parents:** IGCSEs allow seamless education continuity if relocating between countries.
