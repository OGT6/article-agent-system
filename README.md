## Quick Start Guide

### Creating Your First Article

1. **Set up the workspace**:
   ```bash
   /setup-folders
   ```

2. **Choose your topic and run initial SEO analysis**:
   ```bash
   /seo-analysis "your topic keyword" "related keywords"
   ```

3. **Conduct gap analysis** (if you have existing content):
   ```bash
   /gap-analysis "topic" "archive-url1.com, archive-url2.com"
   ```

4. **Execute the complete workflow**:
   ```bash
   /research-article "Article Title as Question?" "both|expat|uk"
   ```

5. **During the workflow, provide**:
   - Archive URLs or sample URLs for voice calibration
   - Approval at gates (Steps 5 and 8)
   - Any specific requirements

### Working with Existing Drafts

To polish an existing draft:
```bash
/voice-polish "path/to/draft.md" "archive-url1.com, archive-url2.com"
```

To add internal linking:
```bash
/internal-linking "path/to/article.md" "archive-urls.txt"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### MCP Server Connection Issues
```bash
# Check server status
claude mcp list

# Reload configuration
claude reload

# Reset and reconnect
claude mcp remove <server-name>
claude mcp add <server-name> <command> [args...]
```

#### Voice Calibration Errors
- Ensure URLs are accessible and valid
- Provide 3-5 archive links for best results
- Check that archive content matches topic area

#### Research Phase Challenges
- Focus on .gov and .edu domains
- Use academic search engines (Google Scholar)
- Verify source dates (prefer within 5 years)

#### Writing Quality Issues
- Review voice calibration document during writing
- Check against quality assurance checklist
- Ensure British spelling throughout
- No em dashes (use commas or parentheses)

#### File Organization Problems
- Always use `/setup-folders` first
- Follow naming conventions strictly
- Keep related files in same topic folder

### Error Messages

**"No archive URLs provided"**
- Solution: Provide URLs during approval gates
- Use sample URLs for new topic areas

**"MCP server not connected"**
- Solution: Run `claude reload`
- Check `.mcp.json` configuration

**"File not found"**
- Solution: Use absolute paths
- Verify file exists with `ls` command
