# Gap Analysis Command

Conduct comprehensive internal content audit AND external competitor analysis to prevent cannibalization while creating content that dominates search rankings through strategic differentiation and superiority.

## Usage
`/gap-analysis [TOPIC/KEYWORD] [AUDIENCE: expat|uk|both] [ARCHIVE_URLS: optional]`

## Examples
`/gap-analysis "IB vs A-levels" both`
`/gap-analysis "school fees UK" both "archive1.com/fees, archive2.com/costs"`

The system will analyze BOTH your existing content (if archive provided) AND top 5 ranking competitors.

## Dual Analysis Framework

### PART A: Internal Content Audit (Prevent Cannibalization)

#### 1. Archive Content Review
**If archive URLs provided, analyze existing content for:**
- Topics already covered comprehensively
- Angles and perspectives used
- Keywords currently ranking for
- Content gaps within existing articles
- Update opportunities vs new content needs
- Internal linking opportunities

#### 2. Cannibalization Prevention Check
```markdown
## Internal Content Audit: [TOPIC]

### Existing Content Coverage
| Article Title | URL | Primary Keywords | Angle/Focus | Rankings | Update Potential |
|--------------|-----|-----------------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| [Title] | [URL] | [Keywords] | [Focus] | [Positions] | [High/Med/Low] |

### Cannibalization Risk Assessment
- [ ] Does proposed topic overlap with existing content?
- [ ] Are we targeting same keywords as existing articles?
- [ ] Can we differentiate sufficiently?
- [ ] Should we update existing vs create new?
- [ ] Are there internal linking opportunities?

### Differentiation Strategy
**If creating new content:**
- Unique angle: [How this differs from existing]
- New keywords: [Terms not currently targeted]
- Different audience focus: [Specific segment]
- Complementary not competing: [How it enhances portfolio]
```

### PART B: External Competitor Analysis

### 1. Content Depth Evaluation

#### Quantitative Metrics
- Word count and comprehensiveness
- Number of subtopics covered
- Citation count and quality
- Data points and statistics
- Practical examples provided

#### Qualitative Assessment
- Explanation clarity
- Nuance and balance
- Cultural sensitivity
- Practical applicability
- Decision-making support

### 2. Audience Coverage Analysis

#### Missing Perspectives
**For Expat Parents:**
- Repatriation implications
- Currency/cost conversions
- Cultural adjustment factors
- Distance from UK considerations
- International university pathways
- Maintaining British identity

**For UK Parents:**
- Regional school variations
- Commute considerations

### 3. Ranking Success Analysis

Identify what makes each top 5 article rank:
- **Search Intent Match**: How well they answer the query

- **User Experience**: Engagement and readability
- **Technical SEO**: Optimization elements

### 4. Information Gap Matrix

```markdown
## Gap Analysis Report: [TOPIC]

### Top 5 Ranking Analysis
