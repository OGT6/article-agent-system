# Voice Calibration Command

Create a mandatory assignment-specific voice analysis document by analyzing either archive links (existing clusters) OR sample URLs (new clusters) to ensure authentic, consistent voice throughout the article.

## Usage
`/voice-calibrate [CONTENT_TYPE: archive|sample] [URLS] [ASSIGNMENT_TOPIC]`

## Examples
**For Existing Content Cluster:**
`/voice-calibrate archive "url1.com/article1, url2.com/article2, url3.com/article3" "IB vs A-levels comparison"`

**For New Content Cluster:**
`/voice-calibrate sample "competitor1.com/article, competitor2.com/article" "School fees guide"`

## Critical Decision Point
**ALWAYS ASK FIRST**: "Is this an existing content cluster (use archive links) or a new topic area (need sample URLs)?"
- **Existing cluster**: Client has published content on this topic
- **New cluster**: Client entering new topic area

## Purpose
This command addresses authenticity issues by creating an assignment-specific voice document that MUST be created before any writing begins. Each assignment gets its own voice analysis to ensure genuine, consistent voice that matches client expectations.

## Process for Archive Links (Existing Content)

### Step 1: Content Analysis
Analyze 3-5 provided articles for:
- **Sentence Structure Patterns**
  - Average sentence length
  - Complexity variations
  - Opening styles
  - Transition preferences

- **Vocabulary Choices**
  - Formality level
  - Technical vs accessible language
  - British vs American preferences
  - Unique word choices

- **Humor Deployment**
  - Frequency per 1000 words
  - Types (dry, observational, self-deprecating)
  - Cultural references used
  - Timing and placement

- **Tone Variations**
  - By topic type
  - For serious vs light content
  - Audience adjustments
  - Emotional range

### Step 2: Pattern Documentation
Create comprehensive voice fingerprint:
```markdown
## Voice Analysis Document - [Client/Project Name]

### Core Voice Characteristics
- Primary tone: [e.g., "Authoritative yet approachable"]
- Humor style: [e.g., "Dry British understatement, 2-3 instances per article"]
- Formality level: [e.g., "Professional but conversational"]
- Cultural lens: [e.g., "British expat perspective with international awareness"]

### Signature Elements
**Phrases that appear frequently:**
- [Example phrase patterns]
- [Transitional preferences]
- [Opening gambits]

**Vocabulary preferences:**
- British spelling: [honour, colour, realise]
- Preferred terms: [e.g., "whilst" over "while"]
- Avoided terms: [corporate jargon, Americanisms]

### Structural Patterns
- Paragraph length: [typical range]
- Section transitions: [preferred styles]
- Example integration: [how examples are introduced]
- Data presentation: [how statistics are woven in]

### Humor Guidelines
- Frequency: [X jokes per 1000 words]
- Style: [types that work]
- Placement: [where humor appears]
- Topics: [what's fair game]
- Boundaries: [what to avoid]

### Do's and Don'ts
**Always:**
- [Specific practices to maintain]
- [Voice elements to emphasize]
- [Authentic touches to include]

**Never:**
- [Elements that break authenticity]
- [Phrases that don't fit]
- [Tones to avoid]
```

## Process for Sample URLs (New Content)

### Step 1: Competitive Voice Analysis
When creating new content cluster:
- Analyze 2-3 sample URLs for industry voice standards
- Identify what to emulate and what to avoid
- Note differentiation opportunities
- Create unique voice position

### Step 2: Voice Strategy Document
```markdown
## Voice Strategy - [Topic Cluster]

### Industry Voice Landscape
**Common approaches:**
- [What competitors do]
- [Standard tone in space]
- [Typical formality level]

### Our Differentiation
**We will stand out by:**
- [Unique voice elements]
- [Different perspective]
- [Distinctive tone]

### Voice Guidelines
- Core tone: [defined approach]
- Humor integration: [if appropriate]
- Technical level: [accessibility]
- Cultural perspective: [angle]

### Example Transformations
**Industry standard:** "[typical sentence]"
**Our voice:** "[transformed sentence]"

### Authenticity Checklist

```

## Integration Requirements

- Are signature elements present?
- Is humor frequency correct?
- Do transitions feel authentic?

### Red Flags for Inauthenticity
- Generic educational tone
- Forced humor
- Inconsistent formality
- Missing signature elements
- Corporate speak creeping in

### Document Lifecycle
1. **Create**: New voice document for EACH assignment
2. **Reference**: Keep open during entire writing process
3. **Apply**: Check every paragraph against voice profile
4. **Save**: Archive for future similar assignments
5. **Update**: Refine based on client feedback

### Quality Assurance Checklist
Before starting any article:
- [ ] Voice calibration decision made (archive vs sample)
- [ ] URLs obtained and analyzed
- [ ] Assignment-specific voice document created
- [ ] Voice fingerprint extracted and documented
- [ ] Authenticity markers identified
- [ ] Writing can now begin

## Critical Reminders

### For Archive Analysis
- **NEVER** proceed without analyzing actual client content
- **ALWAYS** extract real patterns, not generic assumptions
- **DOCUMENT** specific phrases and structures found
- **APPLY** discovered patterns throughout new content

### For Sample Analysis
- **CLEARLY** differentiate from provided samples
- **CREATE** unique voice position
- **AVOID** direct copying of sample voice
- **ESTABLISH** authentic new voice for client

## Remember
**Voice calibration is MANDATORY for EVERY assignment.** Each article requires its own voice analysis document. This prevents authenticity issues and ensures consistent, genuine voice that builds trust, engagement, and rankings. Generic content without voice calibration will fail both readers and search engines.
